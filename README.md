#  Machine Learning Assignments & Projects

A collection of structured machine learning coursework assignments completed as part of the **Foundations of Machine Learning** course (2024).
This repository showcases end-to-end ML workflows, including **EDA**, **statistical analysis**, **feature engineering**, **classical ML models**, and **evaluation techniques** across a variety of datasets and problem types.

---

##  Overview

This repository contains **five machine learning projects**, each focusing on a different set of concepts and techniques.
The assignments cover:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Hypothesis testing & statistics
* Regression & classification models
* Cross-validation strategies
* Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
* Clustering methods
* Handling text data (Persian NLP)
* Tree-based models (XGBoost, LGBM, CatBoost)
* Model evaluation, comparison & interpretation
* Pipeline construction & reproducible workflows
